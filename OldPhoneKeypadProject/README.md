# Old Phone Keypad C# Project

## Description
This project provides a keypad function in old phone by converting the input numbers into correspond characters.
In this project, I don't take consider input with subsequence **(delete twice) becuase there is only immediate deleting subsequence charater when * enter in a real keypad function.
Instead, I take consider about pressing more than limited number like when we pressed 2, normally it generate A (1st time), B (2nd time) and C (3rd time) and how about pressing 2 four times or above and I consider if pressed 4 times, it will output A and 5 times B and so on.
